Refactor conversation actions to an existential type consisting of a singleton
tag (identifying the action) and a dedicated type for the action itself.
Previously, actions were represented by a big sum type. The new approach
enables us to describe the needed effects of an action much more precise.
The existential type is initialized by the Servant endpoints in a way to
mimic the previous behavior. But, the messages between services changed.
Thus, all federated backends need to run the same (new) version. The
deployment order itself does not matter.
